# Remote-Home-Station

This repo consists of the node flows for the Front-End side of Remote-Home-Station project.

This project was built with my team in 7 weeks using Scrum Development methods consisting of 1 week Sprints.

The Front-End side was built in Node-Red IDE which was on the Raspberry PI.

Node-Red is an easy to use visual editor which allows alot the work time
to be used for developing new ideas instead of learning basics of node.js
